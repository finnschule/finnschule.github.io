### [The Sustainability of State and Local Pensions: A Public Finance Approach.](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/15872-BPEA-SP21_WEB_Lenney-et-al.pdf) 
*With Jamie Lenney, Byron Lutz, and Louise Sheiner.* Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Spring 2021.

We explore the fiscal sustainability of US state and local government pension plans. Specifically, we examine whether, under current benefit and funding policies, state and local pension plans will ever become insolvent and if so, when. We then examine the fiscal cost of stabilizing pension debt as a share of the economy and examine the cost associated with delaying such stabilization into the future. We find that, despite the projected increase in the ratio of beneficiaries to workers as a result of population aging, state and local government pension benefit payments as a share of the economy are currently near their peak and will eventually decline significantly. This previously undocumented pattern reflects the significant reforms enacted by many plans which lower benefits for new hires and cost-of-living adjustments often set beneath the expected pace of inflation. Under low or moderate asset return assumptions, we find that few plans are likely to exhaust their assets over the next few decades. Nonetheless, under these asset returns, plans are currently not sustainable as pension debt is set to rise indefinitely; plans will therefore need to take action to reach sustainability. But the required fiscal adjustments are generally moderate in size and in all cases are substantially lower than the adjustments required under the typical full prefunding benchmark. We also find generally modest returns, if any, to starting this stabilization process now versus a decade in the future. Of course, there is significant heterogeneity, with some plans requiring very large increases to stabilize their pension debt.

### [Unemployment in a Production Network](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4449027) 
*With Haoyu Sheng.*

We develop a framework for studying unemployment in a production network by incorporating sector-specific search and matching frictions. We derive aggregation formulae for how output and unemployment respond to sector-specific productivity and labor supply shocks. Specifically, output aggregation can be decomposed into two channels, the input-output channel, which can be expressed in terms of sales shares, and the network-adjusted search-and-matching channel, which depends on the interaction between labor market frictions and an occupational-labor-share-weighted Leontief inverse. We show that the foundational theorem of Hulten (1978) is a special case of the network we study, when wages respond to exactly offset changes in the network-adjusted marginal productivity of labor. Additionally, the wage assumption is essential for determining whether matching frictions amplify or dampen the impact of shocks. For example, when wages rise by less than the network-adjusted marginal product of labor in response to a positive technology shock, firms increase their hiring, amplifying the positive effect on output, and vice versa.  We calibrate our model to the US data and show that search and matching is both quantitatively and qualitatively important for the propagation of technology and labor force shocks.
