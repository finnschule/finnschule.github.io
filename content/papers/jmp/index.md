summary: "(JOB MARKET PAPER) I develop a New Keynesian model with input-output linkages, search-and-matching frictions, and sticky prices to study how sector-specific shocks propagate through the economy to output and inflation. Firms compete for workers from a common labor pool, creating a labor-market propagation channel: higher demand in one sector raises wages and job-finding rates there, redirects household job search, and increases hiring costs elsewhere. Solving the model nonlinearly shows that a sector's importance for inflation and the effects of monetary policy are state-dependent: sectors with higher tightness raise prices more in response to changes in demand or supply. This generates a Phillips curve that steepens as tightness---measured by job vacancies over unemployment---rises, consistent with recent evidence, and implies that monetary policy has larger effects on inflation but smaller effects on output when tightness in some sectors is high."

##### Abstract

I develop a New Keynesian model with input-output linkages, search-and-matching frictions, and sticky prices to study how sector-specific shocks propagate through the economy to output and inflation. Firms compete for workers from a common labor pool, creating a labor-market propagation channel: higher demand in one sector raises wages and job-finding rates there, redirects household job search, and increases hiring costs elsewhere. Solving the model nonlinearly shows that a sector's importance for inflation and the effects of monetary policy are state-dependent: sectors with higher tightness raise prices more in response to changes in demand or supply. This generates a Phillips curve that steepens as tightness---measured by job vacancies over unemployment---rises, consistent with recent evidence, and implies that monetary policy has larger effects on inflation but smaller effects on output when tightness in some sectors is high. I explore the implications for the post-COVID inflation surge by calibrating the model to U.S. input-output and labor market data. The model shows that the post-pandemic shift toward demand for goods alone (holding aggregate demand constant) can account for about 5\% (0.3pp) of the inflation and most of the reduction in measured aggregate matching efficiency. Because labor markets were tight, particularly in the goods sector, keeping interest rates low led to a larger increase in inflation and but a smaller reduction in unemployment than a linearized model would predict.
