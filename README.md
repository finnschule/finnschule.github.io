# Minimalist Hugo Template for Academic Websites

This repository contains a [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) website. The website uses the [PaperMod theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) but modifies it in various ways to be more minimalist and more adapted to academic websites. The website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages).

## Documentation

The template is documented at https://pascalmichaillat.org/d5/.
